#Scato Trader

##Overview
**Scato** will scan the market for presense of doji patterns and deliver opportunities to an investor.  The investor can view opportunities of interest where the application will calculate

1. risk per share
2. risk ratio per share
3. entry point
4. exit point
5. position size (# of shares)

Additionally, the drilling into an oportunity will reveal a candlestick chart of the past 3 months with current price.
